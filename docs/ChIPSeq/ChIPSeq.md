# Data Analysis - ChIP-seq

ChIP-seq data provides invaluable insights into the interactions between proteins and DNA, offering a comprehensive view of gene regulation and epigenetic modifications. In this section, I explore the methods used to examine and visualize this data. This includes data exploration techniques to identify significant patterns and distributions, as well as advanced visualization tools to represent these findings effectively. I also delve into peak calling methods to identify regions of enriched signal corresponding to protein (histone and non-histone)-DNA interactions, and sequence analysis to uncover underlying motifs and regulatory elements.
