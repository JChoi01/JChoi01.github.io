# Data Analysis - RNA-seq

RNA-seq analysis is a powerful technique used to examine the transcriptome of organisms, providing insights into gene expression patterns and functional genomics. This method enables the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) under various conditions, offering a comprehensive view of biological responses and regulatory mechanisms. Key steps in RNA-seq analysis include quality control, alignment, quantification, and DEG analysis, followed by downstream analyses such as visualization, correlation studies, heatmaps, and pathway enrichment analyses like KEGG and GO. These steps collectively facilitate a deeper understanding of the complex molecular landscapes within biological systems.
